    <h2>Regular Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      To maintain high-quality education standards across all branches, 
      <strong>Safal Shaishav conducts regular evaluations</strong> and provides constructive feedback 
      to every franchisee. This ensures that children receive the best learning experience 
      in a joyful, safe, and nurturing environment.

      <h3>Why Evaluation Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Evaluation is not just about checking performance — it is about identifying strengths, 
        recognizing gaps, and guiding franchisees towards continuous improvement.  
        It helps maintain consistency in teaching methods, student growth, and overall school quality.
      </p>

      <li>Teacher performance and classroom practices.</li>
      <li>Student progress tracking and assessments.</li>
      <li>Infrastructure and facility maintenance checks.</li>
      <li>Feedback sessions with parents and the community.</li>
      <li>Administrative and operational efficiency reviews.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Transparency & Support</h3>
      <p>
        All evaluation reports are shared openly with franchisees.  
        Instead of only pointing out issues, our team provides <strong>step-by-step solutions</strong>, 
        training support, and follow-up sessions.  
        This ensures evaluation is a tool for <strong>growth, not pressure</strong>.
