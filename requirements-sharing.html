  <h2>% Sharing Model</h2>
  <p>
    Our franchise revenue-sharing model is designed to ensure mutual growth. 
    It is transparent and supports long-term sustainability.
  </p>

  <h3>How It Works:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A fixed percentage of student fees is shared with Safal Shaishav.</li>
    <li>The remaining is retained by the franchisee to manage operations.</li>
    <li>Sharing percentage is predefined in the contract to avoid confusion.</li>
    <li>Regular financial guidance and audits are provided to support franchisees.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note-box">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Exact percentages will be discussed and finalized during the agreement process.
